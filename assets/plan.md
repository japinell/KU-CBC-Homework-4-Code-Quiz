# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Plan

1. Develop and style HTML interface, which should contain:
   a. An ordered list for the questions.
   b. An unordered list for the potential answers.

2. Create a quiz object to hold the question, an array to hold the potential answers, and an array to hold the correct answer.

3. Create an array of quiz objects.

4. Pick a random question off of the quiz objects array (that should bring the potential answers and the correct answer).

5. Display the question in the ordered list with the potential answers in the unordered list.

6. Allow the user to select one answer and go to step 4.

7. Display whether the user selection was correct or wrong.

8. Go to next step when no more questions in the quiz objects array.

9. Replace the ordered list with a section displaying the final score, and allowing the user the submit their initials.

10. Allow the user to go back to restart the quiz or clear the high scores.

11. The application should include functionality to clear the high scores any time.

12. A one-minute timer will be set at the begining of the quiz.

13. The timer will be added 10 seconds for each question answered correctly.

14. The timer will be substracted 20 seconds for each question answered incorrectly.
